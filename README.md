# Second-Order Finite-Volume Numerical Scheme for Blood Flow PDEs With Stenosis At The Boundary

## Overview: 
In this MATLAB code we implement second-order finite-volume
numerical scheme for blood flow in an artery of length L, where the blood enters
the artery at the left end ($x=0$) and exists the artery at the right end ($x=L$). The
blood flow $Q$ is restricted by stenosis phenomenon on the right boundary
($x=L$).
